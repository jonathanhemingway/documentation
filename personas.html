          <h2>Wendy</h2>
          <p>Wendy is a 20-year-old, college student who goes to Johnson and Wales University. She majors in Hospitality and is going to earn her master's degree in 2 years. She hopes to go on to manage hotels overseas later on in her career. She lives in an apartment off campus with two other people. She loves to read books and magazines and watches tv occasionally. Like many college students, Wendy tends to go to Starbucks quite often. So much so that she tends to use up a significant portion of her meal plan at Starbucks. She occasionally goes to Dunkin Donuts, but most times, its because that's the best spot for coffee around.</p>

            <h2>Michael</h2>
            <p>Michael is a 42-year-old businessman who works in downtown Providence near the Providence Place Mall. He earns around $60,000 a year and lives in Warwick, RI. His commute to work is average for morning traffic but it can get heavy pretty often. Michael loves coffee and has at least three cups a day. He finds himself rushing to get coffee in the morning before he goes to work and is sometimes disappointed to find that his coffee isn't often made right. At lunch, he likes to go to Starbucks or another local coffee shop because it allows him to relax during the busy workday. After work, he either makes coffee at home or goes and grabs a quick cup from either Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts.</p>
