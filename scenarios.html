          <h2>Wendy's Study Session</h2>
          <p>Wendy just got out of her 9:20 AM class and has a few hours before her next class. She would go home, but she has a test that she needs to prepare for and both of her roommates are loud. One of her roommates always brings her boyfriend over and this makes the apartment loud. Her other roommate tends to come to her often to talk and it can be distracting. She wants to go to Starbucks but knows that it can get crowded and busy with people constantly walking in and out. This is a problem especially because the space is so small and cramped. She decides to look up coffee shops nearby and sees a link to Cafe Cup. After reading through the home page, she decides to check it out and finds that it is exactly the kind of space she is looking for. </p>

            <h2>Michael's Long Work Week</h2>
            <p>Michael just got out of a long business meeting with his boss and clients. They just told him that they have a huge account that they are willing to get from the company and Michael and his team don't have much time to get it done. Michael needs to have a large portion of the preliminary stages done by the day after. Michael needs to have a nice, strong cup of coffee now to try to relax and prepare his mind for the upcoming days. He knows that he doesn't want Dunkin Donuts because they don't always get his drink right but Starbucks is a bit too expensive for such a small amount. He asks a coworker where he should go and they tell him about Café Cup which isn’t that far from the office. He looks up the website and is convinced that they are what he needs at that moment and decides to go.</p>
