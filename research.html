          <h2>Conceptualize</h2>
          <p>The concept of Cafe Cup originated quite a while back. I had the idea for the company as a part of another project where I made packaging for K-CUPS. I decided to run with this concept and build upon it.</p>

          <p>I researched the top coffee shops around the country (which were Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts) and around downtown Providence (places like Small Point Cafe, Coffee Exchange, and Blue State Coffee). One thing I realized instantly was that the local businesses did not have great websites. They were very minimal (often times missing vital information).  I chose to make Cafe Cup a competitor of the bigger chains like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts.</p>

          <p>While researching which demographics enjoyed these coffee shops the most, I realized that almost all of the demographics loved these places evenly. I decided to focus on young and middle-aged adults. This was how I came up with the concept of a place that (like Starbucks) had comfortable seating and played music but was also less expensive. </p>

          <p>I took a lot of my inspiration from my competitor's websites as well as other websites like templates. Dunkin Donuts, in particular, is very image heavy which is great because it showcases their products. Starbucks, on the other hand, has very few elements on their homepage and the information is deeper within the site. I one thing that I like about them is their use of textures as opposed to attention-grabbing images. However, their tone is a lot more subdued and Cafe Cup is a bit more lively. </p>
